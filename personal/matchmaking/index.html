                            <li>I ran a small matchmaking party in July 2020 and despite a small group it seemed
                                pretty successful. It generated quite a few potential matches, and led to at least one
                                couple dating.</li>

                        <h3>The Impact of Matchmaking</h3>

                        <p>I think matchmaking is probably underrated. I suspect it’s often the most effective way to
                            use a
                            small amount of time to improve the lives of your immediate social circle.</p>

                        <p>As far as I can tell, many people <i>really</i> want to find a partner when they’re single. I
                            do. My close single friends – both male and female – generally do. The people I surveyed on
                            Mechanical Turk do. (Many of the people I surveyed report they would take on <i>significant
                                risks of immediate death</i> to find a partner!)</p>

                        <p>You probably have several friends and acquaintances who are single and would be grateful for
                            good suggestions on people to meet. (Caveat: thoughtfulness about this is important: there
                            are
                            cases where this kind of thing could be uncomfortable or hurtful.) I’ve asked dozens of
                            single
                            friends if they’d like me to try and matchmake them or if they’d like an introduction to
                            someone, and the answer has almost always been yes, and very appreciative.</p>

                        <p>Can you actually generate good matches? I actually think the probability isn’t that high, but
                            it’s still very worthwhile in expected value. In particular, I suspect the first few minutes
                            you
                            spend thinking about matchmaking is probably really high leverage, with steep diminishing
                            returns. This is because you have fresh potential matches to consider, while your single
                            friends
                            have probably considered everyone who seems like a plausible match that they know. </p>
                        <p>In fact, it
                            wouldn't surprise me at all if in the first hour one spends trying to matchmake, they can
                            generate something like 10x more <a
                                href="https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/">micromarriages per hour</a> for
                            their single friends than those single friends could generate for themselves in an hour.</p>

                        <p>
                            Your friends probably spend a lot of time and energy seeking a partner, at that much lower
                            micromarriages per hour return.
                            I find it pretty exciting to be able to help at such a high multiplier!
                            (I try to set aside 30-60 min twice a year to systematically think about potential matches.)
                            Conversely, it's meant the world to me when friends -- and even kind internet strangers --
                            have tried to set me up.
                        </p>



                        <h3>Matchmaking Seems Unusually Impactful Right Now due to COVID</h3>

                        <p>I suspect that playing matchmaker right now is likely to be unusually impactful. Many of the
                            mechanisms people rely on to meet potential partners have been disrupted by
                            COVID.
                            In a typical year, people have around a 5%/year chance of meeting the person they marry. I’d
                            guess
                            it’s been much lower the last two years.</p>

                        <p>It won’t
                            surprise me if the majority of the good I accomplish personally through matchmaking is
                            accomplished during COVID.</p>

                        <h3>Matchmaking Seems More Effective in Groups</h3>

                        <p>I’ve been deliberately trying to matchmake for around five years. Although I’ve had a few
                            minor
                            successes where I introduced people, the only cases where I’ve seen it lead to a
                            relationship
                            have been when I’ve schemed together with a friend about setting people up.</p>

                        <p>My working model is that the “fuel” of matchmaking is potential matches who haven’t yet
                            considered whether they should date. The reason you can often be more impactful with a
                            marginal
                            hour than your friends can be for themselves is that you know different people. But your
                            social
                            network still overlaps a lot with the friend’s you’re trying to match. If you really want to
                            maximize your probability of suggesting new, potentially really good fits, you want to team
                            up
                            with other people who have different social networks.</p>

                        <p>In July 2020, I ran a virtual “matchmaking party”. It was pretty successful. A small group,
                            in
                            about two hours, generated a bunch of matches and two eventually led to dating, although I
                            don’t know
                            what the long-term relationship outcomes were.</p>

                        <p>I’m going to run a similar event, you can apply to participate here. Due to COVID, the event
                            will be virtual.</p>

                            <p><b>Is the party only for people in the Bay Area?</b>
                                No, it's open to any geography. In the sign-up form, you list what geographic regions
                                you'd
                                be matching people in. If no one else signs up with overlapping regions, I'll try to let

                            <p><b>What will the matchmaking party be like?</b>
                                It will be a video call with some mechanism for breaking off into smaller conversations
                                (maybe Rally?), along with a shared google doc or spreadsheet for listing people you're

                                can’t host as many matchmaking parties as I think should occur!) After the party, I plan
                                to
                                post
                                templates of all my organizational documents for anyone hosting their own event to use.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Why have an event for matchmakers rather than a party where the people looking for
                                    partners
                                    can
                                    directly meet each other?</b>
                                I think events for single people are a pretty brutal format. I’ve
                                gone
                                to a few in the past myself and found them enormously stressful. The emotional stakes
                                are
                                pretty
                                high for people involved, and that makes them awkward and uncomfortable (especially for
                                people
                                who are shy or socially anxious). It also makes things inefficient, because it’s hard
                                for
                                people
                                to just be really honest and rapidly assess compatibility.</p>

                            <p><b>Will everyone who applies to be a matchmaker join the event?</b>
                                It depends on how big the
                                group
                                is.
                                I’m nervous the structure wouldn’t work very well for a group larger than 20-30 people.
                                But
                                I’ll
                                send everyone who applies all my notes so they can organize their own party!</p>

                            <p><b>Can I apply to matchmake myself?</b>
                                We think this will be more effective if people are focused
                                on
                                matchmaking others. We want the emotional stakes to be low, and one is generally pretty
                                invested
                                in finding a match for themselves. If you’re looking for matches yourself, try to think
                                about
                                whether you have any friends you think would be a good matchmaker for you and others!
                                (And
                                also
                                consider if you want to match others – if finding a match would mean a lot to you,
                                helping
                                someone find a match would probably mean an enormous amount to them!)</p>

                            <p><b>I’m single, can I apply to participate as a matchmaker for others?</b>
                                As long as you’re focused
                                on
                                others, I’d be delighted to have you apply! (I’m single myself, and I really want to
                                help
                                other
                                people who are single find great matches.)</p>

                            <p><b>How confidential will the event be?</b>
                                We expect information shared between matchmakers to be
                                treated similarly to information found on a dating website. It isn’t strictly private,
                                but
                                we
                                expect people to treat it with care, and to try to act in the best interests of anyone
                                who’s
                                information they receive access to.</p>

                            <p><b>Why can’t people just use dating websites?</b>
                                Well, a lot of them are probably already doing that.
                                But honestly, I’m pretty negative on dating websites:
                                they seem to structurally encourage a lot
                                of unhealthy things, and I think the <a
                                    href="https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/">micromarriages per hour</a>
                                return is probably
                                worse than lots of other things. My guess is that introductions from friends are
                                literally
                                an order of magnitude better.</p>

                            <p><b>Wouldn’t it make sense to use a professional matchmaker instead?</b>
                                It’s always seemed to me
                                like
                                professional matchmakers paid for by individual clients have uncomfortable incentives
                                (the
                                same
                                could be said of dating websites). I’m pretty excited about the idea of professional
                                matchmakers
                                who are operating in a more “non-profit” style where they're funded by donations
                                intended to
                                support them generally rather than find matches for a specific person. (In fact, last
                                year I
                                made a $10K donation to someone experimenting with this!) But I think it’s unlikely this
                                is
                                going to occur in a widespread enough way to help most of my or your friends in the near
                                future.</p>

                            <p><b>Chris, can you help me find a match?</b>
                                Sorry, I only expect to be able to make helpful matches
                                for
                                people I know fairly well. (If I do know you but don’t know that you’re looking for a
                                partner,
                                please let me know!) Consider who the best person in your social circle to act as a
                                matchmaker
                                would be and send them this event!</p>
